DarkMatter Fractional Mass Prediction
====================================

The goal of this project was to determine the fractional mass of cold dark matter with subhalo substructure using a simulated gravitational lensing dataset. The dataset consists of simulated strong lensing images with cold subhalos generated by PyAutoLens. It contains 20k grayscale images of dimensions 150 * 150, which were divided into a train-validation-holdout set with the following proportions - [0.8, 0.15, 0.15]. For data augmentation, rotation and translation were used.

Model Architecture
------------------

The model of choice was a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which contains 21 CNN operators distributed over 7 residually connected layers. Each layer has 3 CNN sub-layers. In each block, the 3 sub-layers are further residually connected to each other using a scaler gate, which provides dedicated LR (Learning Rate) as well as allowing gradients to flow in each sublayer. The convolution layer outputs are fed into 6 linear 3-2 residually connected layers of the same structure.

Training Details
----------------

The model was trained for 10 epochs; however, the convergence was amazingly fast, achieved in just 2 epochs. The entire training process and custom code were implemented in PyTorch and can be found in this GitHub repository under the `ftrain` package in this github account. Additionally, the code and metrics used for evaluation are available in the `StrongLensingChallenge.ipynb` file.

Dataset
-------

The simulated gravitational lensing dataset used for training and evaluation contains 20,000 grayscale images of size 150 * 150. These images include cold subhalos generated by PyAutoLens. The dataset was split into three sets with the following proportions: 80% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for the holdout set.

Requirements
------------

To run the code in this repository, the following dependencies must be installed:

- PyTorch 
- pytorch-lightning
- Matplotlib
- Ftrain (available under this github account)


Results
-------

The model achieved good performance on the task of predicting the fractional mass of cold dark matter with subhalo substructure. Please refer to the ``StrongLensingChallenge.ipynb`` notebook for detailed evaluation results and visualizations.
